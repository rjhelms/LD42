DESIGN:
- player is on a space station / moon base / something like that
- universe is collapsing!!!
- need to stop it, somehow

- top down 2D (3d would be nice, but not this time!)

- universe collapsing - random tiles turn into "collapsed" state (ie overlayed with impassable tile)
	- choose an existing collapsed tile at random, and add a new one off one cardinal direction from there
	- if it's occupied, try again - hopefully this doesn't hose performace (a coroutine perhaps?)
	- phase in - associated with subspace arrays

- collapse points spread from subspace arrays - need to find them / their control panels and shut them down
	- one you do, associated collapsed tiles return to normal
	
- also have a "phase cannon" that temporarily restores - but it recharges slowly

UPGRADES:
- max power increase - by 4 each time?
- health

ENEMIES:
- patrol bots, mostly - U/D and L/R


TODO:

Mandatory:
- level design
- balance - reduce health???
- escape to quit

Very important:
- title / instruction screen
- multiple (random) phase barrier sprites

Bug fix:
- occasionally still crashing with null GameObject in RemovePhaseBarrier
	- I haven't seen this in a while - it is fixed???

Nice to have:
- more terrain textures
- robot fire / phase barrier spawn sounds
	- only if on screen
