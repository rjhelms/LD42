DESIGN:
- player is on a space station / moon base / something like that
- universe is collapsing!!!
- need to stop it, somehow

- top down 2D (3d would be nice, but not this time!)

- universe collapsing - random tiles turn into "collapsed" state (ie overlayed with impassable tile)
	- choose an existing collapsed tile at random, and add a new one off one cardinal direction from there
	- if it's occupied, try again - hopefully this doesn't hose performace (a coroutine perhaps?)

TODO:
- up / views
- relative projectile firing - in 8 directions
